**Yoa Health Tracker & Coach** is a comprehensive health-tracking platform that enables users to monitor stress, sleep, and workouts while connecting with friends to share and celebrate progress.

## Project Purpose

Yoa Health Tracker & Coach was created to upgrade the experience of the default iOS Health app by going beyond raw data. While the native app collects useful metrics, it lacks personalized insights and meaningful visualizations. Our platform fills that gap by:

* Highlighting your progress over time through dynamic charts and summaries
* Offering contextual feedback to help users understand how they’re improving
* Adding a social layer to health tracking, making it more than just numbers but a shared progress with friends

In short, Yoa Health Tracker & Coach transforms raw health data into actionable insights and motivation.

* Social Features: Add friends, view their progress, and share metrics
* Reactions: React to your friends' workouts and activities
* Admin Dashboard: Manage users and view analytics across the platform
* Visual Analytics: Get visual summaries and insights
* Reminders & Notifications: Stay on track with timely nudges (if enabled)
