## Projec Purpose

Yoa health tracker & coach was created to upgrade the experience of the default iOS Health app by going beyond raw data. While the native app collects useful metrics, it lacks personalized insights and meaningful visualizations. Our platform fills that gap by:

- Highlighting your progress over time through dynamic charts and summaries.
- Offering contextual feedback to help users understand how they’re improving.
- Adding a social layer to health tracking, so it’s not just numbers, but shared progress with friends.
- In short, Yoa health tracker & coach transforms raw health data into actionable insight and motivation.
