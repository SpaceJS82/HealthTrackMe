# HealthTrackMe

**HealthTrackMe** is a comprehensive health-tracking platform that enables users to monitor their stress, sleep, and workouts while connecting with friends to share and celebrate progress. Whether you're looking to stay fit, improve your sleep, or just live healthier with your friends, HealthTrackMe has you covered.

## Projec Purpose

HealthTrackMe was created to upgrade the experience of the default iOS Health app by going beyond raw data. While the native app collects useful metrics, it lacks personalized insights and meaningful visualizations. Our platform fills that gap by:

- Highlighting your progress over time through dynamic charts and summaries.
- Offering contextual feedback to help users understand how they’re improving.
- Adding a social layer to health tracking, so it’s not just numbers, but shared progress with friends.
- In short, HealthTrackMe transforms raw health data into actionable insight and motivation.

- 🧑‍💻 **Admin Dashboard** – Manage users and view analytics across the platform.
- 📊 **Visual Analytics** – Get visual summaries and insights.
- 🔔 **Reminders & Notifications** – Stay on track with timely nudges (if enabled).
