Version 1.0, June 2025

Everyone is permitted to use this app for absolutely any purpose, including (but not limited to):

- Tracking how many burritos you’ve eaten.
- Competing with your cat in step challenges.
- Bragging to friends about sleep you didn’t actually get.

By using this software, you agree to:

- Do cool stuff.
- Not blame us if your smartwatch explodes or if your friends unfriend you after seeing your workout logs.
- Share good vibes and snacks (optional but encouraged).

There is no warranty. Like, literally. If this app causes your toaster to join a gym or makes your fridge insecure about its calorie count, that’s on you.

If you modify it, you must yell "I'm a Health Hacker!" at least once (preferably in a public place), but no one will check, so do what you want.

Now go forth and be healthy… or don’t. We’re not your fitness coach.

❤️ With questionable seriousness,  
The HealthTrackMe Team
